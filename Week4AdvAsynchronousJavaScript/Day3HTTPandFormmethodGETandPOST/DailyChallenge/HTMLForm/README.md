# Daily Challenge: HTML Form → JSON

A simple solution for the exercise.

## What it does
- Renders a form with **First name** and **Last name**.
- On **Send**, it reads the values, creates a tiny object, and prints the **JSON string** to the page.
- Also keeps a small **history list** of your submissions (optional).

## Files
- `index.html` — the page
- `style.css` — very small styles
- `app.js` — the logic

## How to run
Just open `index.html` in your browser (double‑click it). No server needed.

## Bonus ideas (optional)
- Save the history into `localStorage` so it survives a refresh.
- Add more fields (email, age) and validate them.
- Replace the history `<ul>` with a table.
