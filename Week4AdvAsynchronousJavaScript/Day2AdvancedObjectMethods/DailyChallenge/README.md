# Daily Challenge — Creating Objects (TypeScript) 🎬🧱

Define a custom **`Video`** class and practice object-oriented basics.

## ✅ What’s inside
- `class Video { title, uploader, time }`
- `.watch()` returns: **“{uploader} watched all {time} seconds of {title}!”**
- Two instances created and used
- Bonus: array of 5 videos → instantiated in a loop

## 📂 Files
- `VideoObjects.ts` — all code in one file with a small demo (guarded).

## ▶️ Run locally
```bash
# Using ts-node
npx ts-node VideoObjects.ts

# Or compile to JS and run
npx tsc VideoObjects.ts
node VideoObjects.js
```
