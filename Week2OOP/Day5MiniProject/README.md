# 🔤 Day 5 Mini Project – Anagram Checker

Welcome to the final project of the Python OOP module! Instead of building a large library system, Day 5 now focuses on a compact but complete **Anagram Checker** that lets you practise object-oriented design, modular thinking, file handling, and simple CLI flows all in one place.

If you prefer a detailed, learner-friendly walkthrough, jump straight to [`DailyChallenge/README_ANAGRAMS.md`](DailyChallenge/README_ANAGRAMS.md). The highlights are summarised below so the whole folder stays in sync.

## 🧩 What You Will Build

You will create an `AnagramChecker` class and a lightweight command-line interface that work together to:

- Validate whether a user-provided word exists in the supplied dictionary.
- Find all valid anagrams for that word (excluding the word itself).
- Offer a tiny menu so learners can explore different inputs quickly.

All of this lives in a single script, [`DailyChallenge/anagram_checker_all.py`](DailyChallenge/anagram_checker_all.py), which keeps the mini-project approachable while still demonstrating good design practices.

```

Feel free to split the code into multiple modules (`anagram_checker.py`, `anagrams.py`) if you want a multi-file structure. The README_ANAGRAMS file explains how to do that refactor safely.

## ▶️ Quick Start

```bash
cd Week2OOP/Day5MiniProject/DailyChallenge
python anagram_checker_all.py
```

You will see a two-option menu: enter a word or exit. Provide a single alphabetical word and the CLI will print whether it is valid and list any anagrams.
