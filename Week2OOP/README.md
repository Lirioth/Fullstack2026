# 🏗️ Week 2 - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Welcome to Week 2! This week takes your Python skills to the next level by introducing Object-Oriented Programming concepts. You'll learn to think in terms of objects, classes, and the relationships between them.

## 🎯 Week Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- ✅ Understand and apply the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming

- ✅ Build a comprehensive OOP-based mini-project

## 🧠 Core OOP Concepts Covered

### 📦 Fundamental Concepts
- **🏗️ Classes and Objects**: Blueprint and instances
- **🔧 Methods and Attributes**: Behavior and state
- **🎭 Encapsulation**: Data hiding and access control
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Inheritance**: Code reuse and hierarchy
- **🎪 Polymorphism**: Multiple forms and method overriding

### 🌟 Advanced Topics
- **📚 Modules and Packages**: Code organization
- **📁 File I/O**: Reading and writing data

## 🛠️ Common Patterns & Best Practices

### 🏗️ Class Design
```python
class ExampleClass:
    """A well-designed class with proper structure."""
    
    def __init__(self, name, value):
        """Initialize the object with required parameters."""
        self.name = name           # Public attribute
        self._value = value        # Protected attribute
        self.__id = self._generate_id()  # Private attribute
    
    def get_value(self):
        """Getter method for encapsulated data."""
        return self._value
    
    def set_value(self, new_value):
        """Setter method with validation."""
        if self._validate_value(new_value):
            self._value = new_value
    
    def _validate_value(self, value):
        """Protected helper method."""
        return isinstance(value, (int, float)) and value > 0
    
    def __str__(self):
        """String representation for users."""
        return f"{self.name}: {self._value}"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        """String representation for developers."""
        return f"ExampleClass('{self.name}', {self._value})"
```

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Inheritance Pattern
```python
class Animal:
    """Base class for all animals."""
    
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
    
    def make_sound(self):
        """Override this in subclasses."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement make_sound")

class Dog(Animal):
    """Dog class inheriting from Animal."""
    
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name, "Canine")
        self.breed = breed
    
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common OOP Issues
| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `AttributeError` | Accessing non-existent attribute | Check attribute names and initialization |
| `TypeError` in inheritance | Incorrect super() usage | Review parent class constructor |
| Circular imports | Poor module organization | Restructure imports and dependencies |
| Memory leaks | Strong references in objects | Use weak references when appropriate |

### 💡 Success Tips
- **🎯 Think in objects**: Identify real-world entities to model
- **📝 Plan before coding**: Design your class hierarchy first
- **🔍 Use inheritance wisely**: Don't inherit just for code reuse
- **🧪 Test frequently**: Create simple objects to verify behavior
- **📚 Read others' code**: Study well-designed OOP examples
