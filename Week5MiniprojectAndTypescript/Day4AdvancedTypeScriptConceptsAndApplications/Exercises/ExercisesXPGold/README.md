# ExercisesXPGold â€” Advanced TypeScript (Single File)

Solutions for Exercises XP Gold (1â€“5) in a single TypeScript file with quick console tests.

## File
- `ExercisesXPGold.ts` â€” all exercises and tests.

## Requirements
- Node.js 18+

## Run with ts-node
```bash
npx ts-node ExercisesXPGold.ts
```

## Compile and run with tsc
```bash
npx tsc ExercisesXPGold.ts
node ExercisesXPGold.js
```

## Notes
- Type assertions (e.g., `value as string`) do not convert values at runtime. For real conversion, use `String(value)` or `value.toString()`.
- Exercise 2 uses a constructor/mapper function to perform a real runtime conversion in a generic way.
