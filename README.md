```

### 🏷️ Naming Conventions
| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 📁 Folders | PascalCase or Week#Topic | `Week1Python`, `ExercisesXP` |
| 🐍 Python files | snake_case | `exercisesxp.py`, `daily_challenge.py` |
| 🌐 JS/TS files | camelCase | `day1.ts`, `userInterface.ts` |
| 🏗️ Classes | PascalCase | `Student`, `DatabaseManager` |
| 🔧 Functions/variables | camelCase (JS/TS), snake_case (Python) | `getUserData()`, `get_user_data()` |

### ✅ Code Quality Standards
- **📖 Documentation**: Docstrings for Python, JSDoc for TypeScript
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Try-catch blocks, input validation
- **🔧 Modularity**: Single responsibility principle, reusable functions
- **🔷 Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces, Python type hints (future)

### 🚫 Version Control Hygiene
- **🧼 Clean Commits**: Keep version history focused on source code and learning materials.
- **📦 Ignore Build Artifacts**: Exclude compiled assets (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`) and local environment files via the project `.gitignore`.
- **🔁 Regenerate Locally**: Rebuild assets as needed instead of committing generated outputs.
