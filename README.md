> ℹ️ **Week5 Tip**: Each TypeScript exercise includes both `ts-node` and `tsc` execution instructions for rapid feedback loops.

---
## 4. 🛠️ Technology Stack & Tools

- **Languages**: Python (Weeks 1–2), JavaScript/TypeScript (Weeks 3–5) with growing emphasis on modern ES features and strong typing.
- **Tooling**: Node.js 18+ for JS/TS execution, `ts-node`/`tsc` for TypeScript compilation, and browser DevTools for DOM/HTTP debugging.【F:Week4AdvAsynchronousJavaScript/Day4AsynchronousJavaScript/Exercises/ExercisesXP/README.md†L28-L36】【F:Week5MiniProjectAndTypeScript/Day4AdvancedTypeScriptConceptsAndApplications/DailyChallenge/README.md†L9-L18】
- **Testing Helpers**: Inline demo blocks (guarded against auto-graders) provide quick sanity checks across TypeScript challenges.【F:Week4AdvAsynchronousJavaScript/Day1AdvancedArrayMethods/DailyChallenge/README.md†L15-L24】【F:Week5MiniProjectAndTypeScript/Day3AdvancedTypeScriptConceptsAndApplications/DailyChallenge/README.md†L5-L15】
- **Planned Additions**: ESLint/Prettier, pytest, and Vitest/Jest remain roadmap priorities (see §11).

---
## 5. 💻 Development Environment Setup

1. **Install prerequisites**
   - Python 3.11+ for Weeks 1–2.
   - Node.js 18+ plus `npm` for DOM, HTTP, async, and TypeScript modules.【F:Week4AdvAsynchronousJavaScript/Day3HTTPandFormmethodGETandPOST/Exercises/exercises-xp-http-forms/README.md†L24-L32】【F:Week5MiniProjectAndTypeScript/Day4AdvancedTypeScriptConceptsAndApplications/DailyChallenge/README.md†L9-L18】
2. **Global tooling (optional but recommended)**
   - `npx ts-node` for running `.ts` files without intermediate builds.【F:Week4AdvAsynchronousJavaScript/Day1AdvancedArrayMethods/DailyChallenge/README.md†L15-L24】
   - Simple static servers (`python -m http.server`, `npx http-server`) for HTTP form demos.【F:Week4AdvAsynchronousJavaScript/Day3HTTPandFormmethodGETandPOST/Exercises/exercises-xp-http-forms/README.md†L24-L32】
3. **Editor setup**
   - Enable ESLint/Prettier or equivalent formatters to keep JS/TS code consistent.
   - Install Python and TypeScript language extensions for intellisense and type checking.
4. **Project tooling**
   - Run `npm install` in the repository root once to download the shared ESLint/Prettier toolchain ⚙️.
   - Run `npm run lint` to audit Week3 JavaScript and Week5 TypeScript sources for common pitfalls before submitting work.
   - Run `npm run format` to apply Prettier's consistent spacing and punctuation rules across those folders.

## 6. ▶️ Running & Testing Code

| Week | Quick start |
|------|-------------|
| 🐍 Week1–2 | Run Python files with `python <file>.py`; add virtual environments for package isolation. |
| 🌐 Week3 | Open HTML files directly in a browser; keep DevTools console visible for logs and interactive debugging.【F:Week3JavaScriptandDOM/Day3LearningDOMEvents/Exercises/ExercisesXP/README_DOM_XP.md†L11-L33】 |
| ⚡ Week4 | Combine browser sessions with Node CLI (`node` or `npx ts-node`) to inspect promises, HTTP submissions, and TypeScript utilities.【F:Week4AdvAsynchronousJavaScript/Day3HTTPandFormmethodGETandPOST/Exercises/exercises-xp-http-forms/README.md†L24-L37】【F:Week4AdvAsynchronousJavaScript/Day4AsynchronousJavaScript/Exercises/ExercisesXP/README.md†L28-L36】 |
| 🔷 Week5 | Execute TypeScript via `npx ts-node` or compile with `npx tsc` followed by `node` for grader-friendly outputs.【F:Week5MiniProjectAndTypeScript/Day2IntroductionToTypeScriptAndKeyConcepts/DailyChallenge/README.md†L15-L23】 |

> 💡 **Automation idea**: Add npm scripts (`npm run dev:week4`) to standardise local servers and TS execution.

### 🧰 Shared npm scripts

- `npm run lint`: Executes ESLint against `Week3JavaScriptandDOM/**/*.js` and `Week5MiniProjectAndTypeScript/**/*.ts`, blending browser and Node environments for accurate feedback.
- `npm run format`: Runs Prettier in write mode across the same paths to keep diffs minimal and beginner-friendly.
