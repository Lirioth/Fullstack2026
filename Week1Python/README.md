## ⚠️ Common Challenges & Solutions

### 🔧 Input Handling Issues
**Problem**: Scripts hang waiting for user input
**Solution**: 
```python
# Wrap interactive code for testing
def main():
    user_input = input("Enter value: ")
    # ... process input

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### 🔄 Type Conversion Errors
**Problem**: `ValueError` when converting user input
**Solution**:
```python
try:
    age = int(input("Enter age: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
```

### 📑 List Index Errors
**Problem**: `IndexError` when accessing list elements
**Solution**:
```python
if 0 <= index < len(my_list):
    value = my_list[index]
else:
    print("Index out of range")
```
