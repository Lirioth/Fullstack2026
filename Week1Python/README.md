## ⚠️ Common Challenges & Solutions

### � Error Guide: "If you see this, do this"

| Error Message | What It Means | Solution |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` | Missing colon or wrong indentation | Check for `:` after `if`, `for`, `def` |
| `NameError: name 'x' is not defined` | Using variable before creating it | Define variable first: `x = 10` |
| `TypeError: '>' not supported...` | Comparing different types | Convert: `int(input())` not `input()` |
| `IndexError: list index out of range` | Accessing non-existent list item | Check: `if i < len(list)` |
| `KeyError: 'key'` | Dictionary key doesn't exist | Use: `dict.get('key', default)` |
| `ValueError: invalid literal for int()` | Converting non-number to int | Validate input first or use try/except |
| `IndentationError` | Inconsistent spaces/tabs | Use 4 spaces (not tabs) everywhere |

### �🔧 Detailed Solutions

#### Problem 1: Input Handling Issues
**Symptom**: Scripts hang waiting for user input during automated testing
**Solution**: 
```python
# ✅ Good: Wrap interactive code
def main():
    user_input = input("Enter value: ")
    # ... process input

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()  # Only runs when script executed directly

# ✅ Better: Add timeout or default for testing
def get_input_with_default(prompt, default=""):
    """Get input with optional default for testing."""
    try:
        return input(prompt)
    except EOFError:  # No input available
        return default
```

#### Problem 2: Type Conversion Errors
**Symptom**: `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'`
**Solution**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: No validation
age = int(input("Enter age: "))  # Crashes on non-numeric input

# ✅ Good: Try-except with loop
while True:
    try:
        age = int(input("Enter age: "))
        break  # Exit loop on success
    except ValueError:
        print("❌ Please enter a valid number")

# ✅ Better: Reusable function with validation
def get_int(prompt, min_val=None, max_val=None):
    """Get validated integer input."""
    while True:
        try:
            value = int(input(prompt))
            if min_val is not None and value < min_val:
                print(f"⚠️ Must be at least {min_val}")
                continue
            if max_val is not None and value > max_val:
                print(f"⚠️ Must be at most {max_val}")
                continue
            return value
        except ValueError:
            print("❌ Please enter a valid number")
```

#### Problem 3: List Index Errors
**Symptom**: `IndexError: list index out of range`
**Solution**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: No boundary check
items = [1, 2, 3]
print(items[5])  # Crashes!

# ✅ Good: Check bounds first
if 0 <= index < len(items):
    value = items[index]
else:
    print("❌ Index out of range")

# ✅ Better: Use .get() equivalent for lists
def safe_get_list(lst, index, default=None):
    """Safely get list item by index."""
    return lst[index] if 0 <= index < len(lst) else default

# ✅ Best: Use try-except when appropriate
try:
    value = items[index]
except IndexError:
    print(f"❌ No item at index {index}")
    value = None
```

#### Problem 4: Dictionary KeyError
**Symptom**: `KeyError: 'missing_key'`
**Solution**:
```python
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}

# ❌ Bad: Direct access without checking
email = user["email"]  # Crashes if key missing!

# ✅ Good: Use .get() with default
email = user.get("email", "No email provided")

# ✅ Better: Check membership first
if "email" in user:
    email = user["email"]
else:
    email = "No email provided"

# ✅ Best: Use try-except for exceptional cases
try:
    email = user["email"]
except KeyError:
    print("⚠️ Email not found, using default")
    email = "no-email@example.com"
```

#### Problem 5: String/Integer Comparison
**Symptom**: `TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'`
**Solution**:
```python
# ❌ Bad: Comparing string with number
age = input("Age: ")  # This is a STRING!
if age > 18:  # TypeError!

# ✅ Good: Convert first
age = int(input("Age: "))  # Convert to integer
if age > 18:
    print("Adult")

# ✅ Better: Validate and convert
user_input = input("Age: ")
if user_input.isdigit():
    age = int(user_input)
    if age > 18:
        print("Adult")
else:
    print("❌ Please enter a number")
```

### 🐛 Debugging Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Print Statement Debugging
```python
def calculate_total(prices):
    print(f"🐛 DEBUG: prices = {prices}")  # Check input
    total = sum(prices)
    print(f"🐛 DEBUG: total = {total}")    # Check result
    return total
```

#### Strategy 2: Type Checking
```python
# Check variable types during debugging
value = input("Enter number: ")
print(f"Type: {type(value)}, Value: {value}")  # Shows: <class 'str'>
```

#### Strategy 3: Break Down Complex Logic
```python
# ❌ Hard to debug
if len([x for x in items if x > 10 and x % 2 == 0]) > 0:
    # What went wrong?

# ✅ Easy to debug
filtered = [x for x in items if x > 10 and x % 2 == 0]
print(f"Filtered items: {filtered}")  # See intermediate result
if len(filtered) > 0:
    # Now you can see what's happening!
```

### 💡 Prevention Tips

1. **Always validate user input** before using it
2. **Use type hints** to catch type errors early: `def greet(name: str) -> str:`
3. **Test edge cases**: empty lists, None values, negative numbers
4. **Read error messages carefully** - they tell you exactly what's wrong!
5. **Use descriptive variable names** so debugging is easier
