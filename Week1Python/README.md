# Week1Python

Week 1 summary (Fullstack2026 track).

## Daily Contents
- **Day1StartingwithPython**: Basic syntax, types, printing, input, XP / Gold / Ninja tiers + daily challenge.
- **Day2ListsIteratingandFormattingData**: Lists, slicing, `for` & `while` loops, string formatting.
- **Day3Dictionaries**: Dictionaries, access, updates, useful methods.
- **Day4Functions**: Defining functions, parameters, return values, scope.
- **Day5MiniProject**: Slot to integrate all concepts (to be filled when implemented).

## Recommendations
1. Keep a virtual environment outside the repository if you begin adding external packages.
2. Wrap interactive scripts in functions to ease testing.
3. Add simple tests later (e.g. with `unittest` or `pytest`).

## Quick Run
Example:
```
python Day1StartingwithPython/Exercises/ExercisesXP/exercisesxp.py
```

If a script blocks waiting for input and you just want to experiment, temporarily hardâ€‘code test values.

## Next Steps
- Complete the Day 5 mini project.
- Add a `requirements.txt` if dependencies are introduced.
- Refactor long exercises into reusable functions.
