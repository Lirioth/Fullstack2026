## Development Environment

### Setup Requirements
```bash
# Python 3.8+ required
python --version

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv ../week1_env
source ../week1_env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
..\week1_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# No external packages required for Week1
```

### Running Exercises
```bash
# Navigate to specific exercise
cd Day1StartingwithPython/Exercises/ExercisesXP/

# Run exercises
python exercisesxp.py

# Run mini-project
cd Day5MiniProject/MiniProjectTicTacToe/
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Input Handling Issues
**Problem**: Scripts hang waiting for user input
**Solution**: 
```python
# Wrap interactive code for testing
def main():
    user_input = input("Enter value: ")
    # ... process input

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Type Conversion Errors
**Problem**: `ValueError` when converting user input
**Solution**:
```python
try:
    age = int(input("Enter age: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number")
```

### List Index Errors
**Problem**: `IndexError` when accessing list elements
**Solution**:
```python
if 0 <= index < len(my_list):
    value = my_list[index]
else:
    print("Index out of range")
```
