## 🔧 Development Process

### 1. 📋 Planning Phase
- **Understand requirements**: Read project specifications carefully
- **Break down the problem**: Identify major components and functions needed
- **Design data structures**: Plan how to represent game state
- **Sketch the flow**: Outline the main game loop and user interactions

### 2. 🏗️ Implementation Phase
- **Start small**: Build basic functionality first
- **Test frequently**: Run your code after each major addition
- **Refactor regularly**: Improve code organization as you go
- **Document as you code**: Add comments and docstrings

### 3. 🧪 Testing Phase
- **Test edge cases**: Try invalid inputs and unusual scenarios
- **Verify game rules**: Ensure all winning conditions work
- **Get feedback**: Have someone else try your game
- **Polish the experience**: Improve user interface and messages

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### 🐍 Python Features to Demonstrate
- **Variables & Data Types**: Effective use of strings, integers, booleans
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements and loops
- **Data Structures**: Lists for board state, dictionaries for player data
- **Functions**: Modular code with clear function responsibilities
- **Input/Output**: User interaction and display formatting

### 📋 Code Quality Standards
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Structure**: Organize code into logical functions
- **Comments**: Explain complex logic and function purposes
- **Error Handling**: Validate user input and handle edge cases

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Project Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Logic errors in game rules | Step through code manually with test cases |
| Input validation failing | Test with various input types and edge cases |
| Code becoming too complex | Break large functions into smaller ones |
| Hard to track game state | Use clear variable names and add debug prints |

### 💡 Success Strategies
- **🐌 Start simple**: Get basic version working first
- **🔍 Debug systematically**: Use print statements to track values
- **📚 Reference previous days**: Apply patterns from earlier exercises  
- **🤝 Ask for help**: Don't hesitate to seek guidance when stuck
