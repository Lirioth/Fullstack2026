# 🧩 Challenges — 20 Python Exercises (Functions • Loops • Conditionals) ✨

This package includes a **single Python file** with clear, commented solutions for 20 classic coding challenges.  
Everything is **English-only**, with a friendly README full of emojis. ✅

## 📦 Files
- `challenges_solutions.py` — all 20 exercises implemented + a small demo runner
- `README.md` — this guide

## 🚀 Run
```bash
python3 challenges_solutions.py
```
You’ll see a quick demo of each function with sample inputs and outputs.

## 🗂️ Exercises Covered
1. Insert an item at a defined index in a list.  
2. Count the spaces in a string.  
3. Count uppercase vs lowercase letters.  
4. Sum a list without using `sum()`.  
5. Find the max value without `max()`.  
6. Compute factorial of a number.  
7. Count an element in a list without `.count()`.  
8. Compute the L2 norm (`sqrt(sum(x^2))`).  
9. Check if a list is monotonic (non-decreasing or non-increasing).  
10. Print/return the longest word in a list.  
11. Split a mixed list into integers and strings.  
12. Check if a string is a palindrome.  
13. Count words with length > k in a sentence.  
14. Average of values in a dictionary.  
15. Common divisors of two numbers (excluding 1).  
16. Test if a number is prime.  
17. Return elements whose **index** and **value** are even.  
18. Count the number of values by their exact type from `**kwargs`.  
19. Mimic `str.split()` (whitespace by default, or a custom separator).  
20. Convert a string into password format (same length, all `*`).  

## 💡 Notes
- Functions avoid using banned built-ins where relevant (e.g., `sum`, `max`, `.count`).  
- Small, readable loops and conditionals keep the logic crystal clear.  
- The demo under `if __name__ == "__main__":` prints example results so you can sanity‑check quickly. 🧪

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Add unit tests (e.g., `pytest`).
- Expand docstrings with edge cases.
- Turn this into a mini‑library you can import from other projects.

Happy coding! ✨🐍
