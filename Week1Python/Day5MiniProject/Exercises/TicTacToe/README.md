## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- ✅ **Work with 2D data structures** representing game boards
- ✅ **Implement win detection algorithms** checking rows, columns, diagonals
- ✅ **Build turn-based game logic** alternating between players
- ✅ **Practice input validation** ensuring valid moves
- ✅ **Handle edge cases** detecting ties and full boards
- ✅ **Create user-friendly interfaces** with clear board display

## 📂 Project Structure

```
TicTacToe/
└── tictactoe.py         # Complete game implementation
```

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Navigate to the TicTacToe directory
cd Exercises/TicTacToe

# Run the game
python tictactoe.py
```

## 🎮 Game Rules

1. **Setup**: 3x3 grid numbered 1-9
   ```
   1 | 2 | 3
   ---------
   4 | 5 | 6
   ---------
   7 | 8 | 9
   ```

2. **Gameplay**:
   - Player X starts first
   - Players alternate turns
   - Choose a number (1-9) to place your mark
   - First player to get 3 in a row wins
   - Game ends in tie if board fills with no winner

3. **Win Conditions**:
   - Horizontal: Three marks in same row
   - Vertical: Three marks in same column
   - Diagonal: Three marks from corner to corner

## 💡 Key Features

### Board Display
```
Current board:
 X |   | O
-----------
   | X |  
-----------
 O |   | X
```

### Win Detection
- **Rows**: Checks all 3 horizontal lines
- **Columns**: Checks all 3 vertical lines
- **Diagonals**: Checks both diagonal lines (top-left to bottom-right, top-right to bottom-left)

### Input Validation
- Rejects numbers outside 1-9 range
- Prevents overwriting occupied squares
- Handles invalid input gracefully

### Tie Detection
- Monitors board fullness
- Declares tie when no moves remain and no winner

## 🧩 Example Game

```
Player X, choose a position (1-9): 5
   |   |  
-----------
   | X |  
-----------
   |   |  

Player O, choose a position (1-9): 1
 O |   |  
-----------
   | X |  
-----------
   |   |  

Player X, choose a position (1-9): 3
 O |   | X
-----------
   | X |  
-----------
   |   |  

Player O, choose a position (1-9): 7
 O |   | X
-----------
   | X |  
-----------
 O |   |  

Player X wins! 🎉
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Board not displaying** | Check terminal width, ensure at least 15 characters wide |
| **Invalid move accepted** | Verify `is_valid_move()` function checks both range and occupation |
| **Winner not detected** | Review `check_winner()` logic for all 8 winning combinations |
| **Game continues after win** | Ensure main loop breaks when `check_winner()` returns True |

## 🎓 Concepts Demonstrated

1. **2D Data Structures**
   - Board represented as list of lists `[[],[],[]]`
   - Index mapping: position → row/col coordinates
   - State tracking for each cell

2. **Algorithm Design**
   - Win detection with row/column/diagonal checks
   - Move validation logic
   - Tie detection algorithm

3. **Game State Management**
   - Current player tracking
   - Move history implicit in board state
   - Win/tie/ongoing states

4. **User Interface**
   - Clear board visualization
   - Informative prompts
   - Victory/tie announcements

## 📝 Code Quality Notes

- ✅ **Clean function separation** (display, validation, win checking)
- ✅ **Type hints** for better code clarity
- ✅ **Descriptive variable names** (`current_player`, `board`)
- ✅ **No external dependencies** - pure Python 3.8+
- ✅ **Comprehensive comments** explaining game logic

## 🎯 Extension Ideas

Want to enhance the game? Try:

1. **AI Opponent**: Implement computer player with minimax algorithm
2. **Difficulty Levels**: Easy (random), Medium (blocking), Hard (optimal)
3. **Scoreboard**: Track wins/losses/ties across multiple games
4. **Undo Move**: Allow players to take back last move
5. **Board Sizes**: Support 4x4 or 5x5 boards
6. **Themes**: Customize X/O symbols (emojis, colors)
