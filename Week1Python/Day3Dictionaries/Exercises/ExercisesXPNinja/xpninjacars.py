"""Exercises XP Ninja â€” Exercise 1: Cars

This script solves the tasks:
- Convert a comma-separated string of manufacturers into a list.
- Print count and descending (Z-A) order.
- Count manufacturers with 'o' (case-insensitive) and without 'i' (case-insensitive).
- Bonus: remove duplicates from a given list and print as a comma-separated string with the new count.
- Bonus: print ascending (A-Z) list but each manufacturer name reversed.
