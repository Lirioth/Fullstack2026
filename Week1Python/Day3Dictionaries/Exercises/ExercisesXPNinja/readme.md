# Exercises XP Ninja — Cars 🚗🧠

**Python** script that solves the manufacturers exercise (arrays, conditionals, and sets).

## ✅ What it does
- Converts the string into a list.
- Shows how many manufacturers there are.
- Prints the list in **descending order (Z‑A)**.
- Counts how many contain the letter **"o"** and how many **do not** contain **"i"** (case-insensitive).
- **Bonus**: removes duplicates while preserving order and prints the list on a single line with the **new total**.
- **Bonus**: prints the list in **ascending order (A‑Z)** but with **each name reversed**.

## ▶️ How to run
```bash
python xpninjacars.py
```

## 🧪 Expected output (summary)
```
Total manufacturers: 5
Descending (Z-A): ['Volkswagen', 'Toyota', 'Honda', 'Ford Motor', 'Chevrolet']
Manufacturers with letter 'o': 5
Manufacturers without letter 'i': 5
No-duplicate list: Honda, Volkswagen, Toyota, Ford Motor, Chevrolet
New total (no duplicates): 5
Ascending A-Z with reversed names: ['elegorhC', 'droM droF', 'adnoH', 'atoyoT', 'negaswolksoV']
```
