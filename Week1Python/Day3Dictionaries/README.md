## 🔧 Dictionary Patterns & Best Practices

### 🗝️ Basic Operations
```python
# Creating dictionaries
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}
empty_dict = {}
dict_from_lists = dict(zip(keys, values))

# Accessing values safely
name = student.get("name", "Unknown")  # Preferred
age = student["age"]                   # Direct access
```

### 🔄 Common Methods
```python
# Dictionary methods
keys = student.keys()      # dict_keys object
values = student.values()  # dict_values object
items = student.items()    # dict_items object

# Updating dictionaries
student.update({"gpa": 3.8, "major": "CS"})
student.setdefault("courses", [])
```

### 🏗️ Nested Structures
```python
# Complex data modeling
school = {
    "students": {
        "alice": {"age": 20, "courses": ["Math", "CS"]},
        "bob": {"age": 19, "courses": ["Physics", "Math"]}
    },
    "courses": {
        "Math": {"instructor": "Dr. Smith", "credits": 3},
        "CS": {"instructor": "Prof. Johnson", "credits": 4}
    }
}
```

### ⚡ Advanced Techniques
```python
# Dictionary comprehensions
squared = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
filtered = {k: v for k, v in data.items() if v > 10}

# Merging dictionaries (Python 3.9+)
merged = dict1 | dict2
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `KeyError` | Use `.get()` method or check with `in` |
| `TypeError` | Ensure keys are immutable (hashable) |
| Nested access errors | Check each level exists before accessing |
| Memory issues | Consider using generators for large datasets |

### 💡 Performance Tips
- **🚀 Use `.get()`**: Safer than direct key access
- **🔍 Check membership**: Use `in` for key existence
- **📊 Choose right structure**: Dict vs list for lookups
- **💭 Plan your keys**: Use meaningful, consistent naming

## 🌍 Real-World Applications

### 📊 Data Processing
- Configuration files (JSON-like structures)
- API response handling
- Database record representation
- Caching and memoization

### 🏗️ Common Patterns
- **Counting**: `counts[item] = counts.get(item, 0) + 1`
- **Grouping**: Organize lists by categories
- **Mapping**: Create lookup tables for fast access
- **Caching**: Store computed results for reuse

## 🔗 Next Steps

- **🔄 Practice**: Build data processing scripts
- **📊 Experiment**: Create your own data models
