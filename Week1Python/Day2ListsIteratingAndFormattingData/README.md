## 🔧 Common Patterns & Best Practices

### 📝 List Operations
```python
# Creating lists
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
mixed = ["hello", 42, True]

# List methods
numbers.append(4)        # Add to end
numbers.insert(0, 0)     # Insert at position
numbers.remove(2)        # Remove first occurrence
numbers.pop()            # Remove and return last
```

### 🔄 Iteration Patterns
```python
# Basic iteration
for item in my_list:
    print(item)

# With index
for i, item in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f"Index {i}: {item}")

# Range-based
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    print(my_list[i])
```

### 🎨 String Formatting
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25

# f-strings (recommended)
print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# .format() method
print("Hello, {}! You are {} years old.".format(name, age))
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `IndexError` | Check list bounds before accessing |
| `ValueError` | Ensure element exists before removing |
| `TypeError` | Verify data types in operations |
| Infinite loops | Check loop conditions and increments |

### 💡 Performance Tips
- **🚀 List comprehensions**: Often faster than explicit loops
- **📦 Choose right data type**: List vs set vs tuple
- **🔍 Avoid repeated searches**: Store indices when needed
- **💭 Think before coding**: Plan your data structure

## 🔗 Next Steps

After mastering Day 2:
