# timed challenge #1 — count occurrence 🔎🔤

A tiny Python script that counts how many times a **character** appears in a **string** (case‑sensitive).

## ▶️ run
```bash
python countoccurence.py
```
Then provide **two lines**:
1) the string
2) the character to count (if you type more than one, only the first character is used)
