```

**Key Learning Points**:

1. **Date Arithmetic**:
```python
# Creating dates
from datetime import date
birth_date = date(1990, 5, 15)  # May 15, 1990
today = date.today()

# Calculating differences
age_years = today.year - birth_date.year
```

2. **Birthday Adjustment**:
```python
# Person born Dec 25, 1990, today is June 1, 2025
age = 2025 - 1990  # = 35

# But birthday hasn't occurred yet!
# Need to subtract 1 if birthday later in year
if (6, 1) < (12, 25):  # (today month, day) < (birth month, day)
    age -= 1  # age = 34 (correct!)
```

3. **Parsing Date Strings**:
```python
# Input: "1990/05/15"
year, month, day = map(int, "1990/05/15".split('/'))
# year=1990, month=5, day=15
```

**Common Mistakes**:
```python
❌ # Wrong - doesn't account for birthday
age = today.year - birth_date.year

✅ # Correct - adjusts for birthday
age = today.year - birth_date.year
if (today.month, today.day) < (birth_date.month, birth_date.day):
    age -= 1
```

### Exercise 2: Series Sum 🧮

**🎯 Objective**: Calculate the sum X + XX + XXX + XXXX using a single digit

**Concepts**: String manipulation, type conversion, mathematical series, loops

**Difficulty**: 🟢 Beginner-Intermediate

**Task**:
Given a digit X (0-9), calculate:
```
X + XX + XXX + XXXX
```

**Examples**:
```
X = 3:
3 + 33 + 333 + 3333 = 3702

X = 5:
5 + 55 + 555 + 5555 = 6170

X = 9:
9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 = 11106
```

**Expected Output**:
```
=== Exercise 2 ===
Enter a digit X: 3
Result: 3702
```

**Solution Approach**:
```python
def series_sum(x):
    """
    Calculate X + XX + XXX + XXXX where X is a digit.
    
    Args:
        x (int): Digit from 0-9
        
    Returns:
        int: Sum of the series
        
    Example:
        >>> series_sum(3)
        3702  # 3 + 33 + 333 + 3333
    """
    # Method 1: String repetition (most readable)
    term1 = int(str(x) * 1)  # "3" → 3
    term2 = int(str(x) * 2)  # "33" → 33
    term3 = int(str(x) * 3)  # "333" → 333
    term4 = int(str(x) * 4)  # "3333" → 3333
    
    return term1 + term2 + term3 + term4
    
    # Method 2: Mathematical formula
    # return x * (1 + 11 + 111 + 1111)
    # return x * 1234
    
    # Method 3: Loop (more flexible for N terms)
    # total = 0
    # for i in range(1, 5):
    #     total += int(str(x) * i)
    # return total


# Main execution
x = int(input("Enter a digit X: "))
result = series_sum(x)
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

**Visual Breakdown**:
```
For X = 3:

Term 1: str(3) * 1 = "3"     → int("3")    = 3
Term 2: str(3) * 2 = "33"    → int("33")   = 33
Term 3: str(3) * 3 = "333"   → int("333")  = 333
Term 4: str(3) * 4 = "3333"  → int("3333") = 3333
                                           ------
                                    Sum =   3702
```

**Alternative Approaches**:

1. **Mathematical Formula**:
```python
# Pattern: X * (1 + 11 + 111 + 1111)
result = x * 1234
```

2. **Flexible Loop** (works for any number of terms):
```python
def series_sum_n_terms(x, n):
    """Calculate X + XX + XXX + ... (n terms)"""
    return sum(int(str(x) * i) for i in range(1, n + 1))

# For 4 terms
series_sum_n_terms(3, 4)  # 3702
```

3. **Mathematical Generation** (no strings):
```python
def generate_term(digit, length):
    """
    Generate XX...X with 'length' repetitions.
    Example: generate_term(3, 4) = 3333
    """
    # 3333 = 3 * 1111
    # 1111 = (10^4 - 1) / 9
    return digit * ((10**length - 1) // 9)

def series_sum_math(x):
    return sum(generate_term(x, i) for i in range(1, 5))
```

**Test Cases**:
| X | Calculation | Result |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 0 | 0 + 00 + 000 + 0000 | 0 |
| 1 | 1 + 11 + 111 + 1111 | 1234 |
| 3 | 3 + 33 + 333 + 3333 | 3702 |
| 5 | 5 + 55 + 555 + 5555 | 6170 |
| 9 | 9 + 99 + 999 + 9999 | 11106 |

### Exercise 3: Double Dice 🎲

**🎯 Objective**: Simulate rolling two dice until they match, calculate average attempts over 100 trials

**Concepts**: `random` module, simulation, loops, statistics, averages

**Difficulty**: 🟡 Intermediate

**Task**:
1. Create `throw_dice()` function that returns random number 1-6
2. Create `throw_until_doubles()` that counts throws until both dice match
3. Run 100 trials of `throw_until_doubles()`
4. Calculate and display total throws and average (2 decimal places)

**Expected Output**:
```
=== Exercise 3 ===
Total throws: 314
Average throws to reach doubles: 3.14
```
*Note: Results vary due to randomness*

**Solution Approach**:
```python
import random

def throw_dice():
    """
    Simulate throwing a single die.
    
    Returns:
        int: Random number from 1 to 6
    """
    return random.randint(1, 6)


def throw_until_doubles():
    """
    Throw two dice until they show the same number.
    
    Returns:
        int: Number of throws needed to get doubles
    """
    throws = 0
    
    while True:
        throws += 1
        die1 = throw_dice()
        die2 = throw_dice()
        
        if die1 == die2:
            return throws


def main():
    """Run 100 trials and calculate statistics."""
    trials = 100
    total_throws = 0
    
    # Run simulations
    for _ in range(trials):
        throws = throw_until_doubles()
        total_throws += throws
    
    # Calculate average
    average = total_throws / trials
    
    # Display results
    print(f"Total throws: {total_throws}")
    print(f"Average throws to reach doubles: {average:.2f}")


# Run the simulation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**How It Works**:

1. **Single Trial Example**:
```
Throw 1: Die1=3, Die2=5 → No match, continue
Throw 2: Die1=2, Die2=4 → No match, continue
Throw 3: Die1=6, Die2=6 → MATCH! Return 3
```

2. **100 Trials**:
```
Trial 1: 3 throws
Trial 2: 5 throws
Trial 3: 1 throw (lucky!)
Trial 4: 7 throws
...
Trial 100: 2 throws

Total: 314 throws
Average: 314 / 100 = 3.14 throws per trial
```

**Statistical Analysis**:

The probability of getting doubles on any single throw:
```
Possible doubles: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6) = 6 outcomes
Total outcomes: 6 × 6 = 36
Probability = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 16.67%

Expected value (theoretical average):
E = 1/p = 1/(1/6) = 6 throws

But in practice, you'll see values around 3-4 throws 
because the distribution is geometric.
```

**Enhancements**:

1. **Track Distribution**:
```python
from collections import Counter

def analyze_distribution():
    trials = 1000
    results = [throw_until_doubles() for _ in range(trials)]
    
    print(f"Average: {sum(results) / len(results):.2f}")
    print(f"Min: {min(results)}, Max: {max(results)}")
    
    # Show frequency
    freq = Counter(results)
    for throws, count in sorted(freq.items())[:10]:
        print(f"{throws} throws: {count} times ({count/trials*100:.1f}%)")
```

2. **Deterministic Testing**:
```python
# For testing, set random seed
random.seed(42)  # Same results every time
total = sum(throw_until_doubles() for _ in range(100))
print(f"Total: {total}")  # Always same output with seed=42
```

**Common Mistakes**:
```python
❌ # Wrong - infinite loop if no return
def throw_until_doubles():
    while True:
        if throw_dice() == throw_dice():  # These are DIFFERENT calls!
            break
    # No return statement!

✅ # Correct - store values, compare, return
def throw_until_doubles():
    throws = 0
    while True:
        throws += 1
        die1 = throw_dice()
        die2 = throw_dice()
        if die1 == die2:
            return throws
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Solutions

### Manual Testing

```python
# Test Exercise 1
>>> get_age(1990, 5, 15)
35  # Assuming today is after May 15, 2025

>>> can_retire('m', '1955/03/10')
True  # 70 years old, men retire at 67

>>> can_retire('f', '1965/06/20')
False  # 60 years old, women retire at 62

# Test Exercise 2
>>> series_sum(3)
3702
>>> series_sum(1)
1234
>>> series_sum(0)
0

# Test Exercise 3
>>> throw_dice() in range(1, 7)
True  # Result is 1-6

>>> result = throw_until_doubles()
>>> result >= 1
True  # Takes at least 1 throw
```

## 🐛 Common Errors & Solutions

### Error 1: Date parsing issues
```python
❌ # Wrong - might raise ValueError
year, month, day = "1990/5/3".split('/')  # Works
date(year, month, day)  # TypeError! They're strings!

✅ # Correct - convert to integers
year, month, day = map(int, "1990/5/3".split('/'))
date(year, month, day)  # Works!
```

### Error 2: String to int conversion
```python
❌ # Wrong - results in string concatenation
result = str(3) * 4  # "3333" (string)
total = result + result  # "33333333" (oops!)

✅ # Correct - convert to int first
result = int(str(3) * 4)  # 3333 (integer)
total = result + result  # 6666 (correct)
```

### Error 3: Comparing different dice throws
```python
❌ # Wrong - each call generates new random number
if throw_dice() == throw_dice():  # DIFFERENT values!

✅ # Correct - store first, then compare
die1 = throw_dice()
die2 = throw_dice()
if die1 == die2:
```
