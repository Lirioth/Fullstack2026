# ü§ù Contributing to Fullstack2026

Thank you for helping the Fullstack2026 curriculum shine! This guide distills our collaboration habits so every addition stays consistent, friendly, and beginner-focused.

## üõ£Ô∏è Quick Contribution Workflow
1. **Fork & Clone** ‚Äì Keep your main branch clean; branch from `main` with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/week3-form-validation`).
2. **Sync Often** ‚Äì Rebase or merge from `main` regularly to avoid conflicts.
3. **Scope Your Work** ‚Äì Prefer small, focused pull requests with a clear learning objective.
4. **Write & Run Tests** ‚Äì Use the language-appropriate tooling (pytest, `node --test`, manual DOM checks) before opening a PR.
5. **Open the PR** ‚Äì Fill in the template, link related issues, and summarise changes with one friendly emoji.
6. **Iterate Promptly** ‚Äì Address review feedback quickly; add follow-up commits rather than force-pushing when conversations are ongoing.

## üßæ Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Update **README.md** and week-specific guides if paths, tooling, or learning outcomes change.
- [ ] Include screenshots/GIFs for front-end updates when feasible.
- [ ] Mention impacted folders and run commands in the PR description.
- [ ] Confirm linters/tests pass locally and note any intentional skips (with reason).
- [ ] Ensure docs cite source files or commands where possible to ease auditing.

## üêû Issue Reporting Guidelines
- Provide a concise title plus a detailed description (what happened, what you expected, reproduction steps).
- Tag the relevant week/day and label the issue (`bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`).
- Attach console logs, stack traces, or screenshots when available.
- Suggest a fix or learning outcome adjustment if you have ideas.

## üß† Coding Standards Overview
We align with the [Code Quality Standards](README.md) plus the extra details below.

### Python (Weeks 1‚Äì2)
- **Style**: PEP 8, snake_case for files/functions, PascalCase for classes.
- **Docstrings**: Google-style with examples for every public module, class, and function.
- **Error Handling**: Guard user input with `try/except`, surface actionable messages, and avoid leaking stack traces unless `--debug` is provided.
- **Structure**: Use `if __name__ == "__main__":` guards, factor repeated logic into helpers, prefer pure functions.
- **Tooling**: Run `flake8` and `pytest` (when tests exist). Future additions should include type hints to satisfy `mypy`.

### JavaScript & TypeScript (Weeks 3‚Äì5)
- **Modules**: Use ES modules (`import`/`export`).
- **Naming**: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes and React components.
- **Documentation**: Add JSDoc to public APIs (functions, classes, modules) describing params, return values, and examples.
- **Error Handling**: Wrap DOM and async logic in `try/catch` or `.catch` blocks; validate user-provided data before use.
- **Tooling**: Run ESLint/Prettier (configs coming soon) and `tsc --noEmit` or `ts-node --transpile-only` for rapid feedback.

### Shared Expectations
- Keep content in English; emojis are optional but use them sparingly for clarity üíô.
- Avoid duplicating logic‚Äîextract helpers instead.
- Remove unused imports, variables, and files.
- Store sample data in `data/`, keep secrets out of the repo, and rely on `.env` for configuration stubs.

## üìÅ Repository Hygiene
- Honour the [`.gitignore`](.gitignore); do not commit `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, SQLite databases, or IDE settings.
- When renaming folders, update all references in documentation and code.
- Prefer `pathlib` (Python) and `URL`/`new URL()` (JS/TS) for path manipulations.

## ‚úÖ Submitting Your PR
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with a single emoji (e.g., `feat: Add async fetch demo ‚ö°`).
- Summarise your testing steps (commands + results) in the PR description.
- Request a review from the maintainers list in `README.md` and be ready to demo live exercises if asked.

## üôè Code of Conduct
Respectful communication keeps this community thriving. Be empathetic, encourage beginners, and celebrate progress loudly. If conflicts arise, contact the maintainers privately for mediation.

Happy coding and teaching! ‚òï
