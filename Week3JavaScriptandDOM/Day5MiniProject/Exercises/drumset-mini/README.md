# Drumset — Mini Project

This is a tiny, focused implementation of the drumset exercise.

## How to run
- Put your sound files in the `sounds/` folder. Names expected by default:
  `clap, hihat, kick, openhat, boom, ride, snare, tom, tink`
  (use `.wav` or `.mp3`).  
  If you're using the provided repo's sounds, just copy them into this folder.
- Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Controls
- Press A S D F G H J K L on your keyboard, or click/tap the pads.

## Customize
- Edit the mapping in `js/app.js` (`SAMPLES` object).
- Rename pads by changing each button’s `data-sample` and text.
