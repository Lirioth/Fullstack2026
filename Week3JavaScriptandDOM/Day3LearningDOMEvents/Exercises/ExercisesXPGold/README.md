# Exercises XP Gold — DOM & Forms

**Last Updated:** October 7th, 2025

## What we will learn
- Working with the DOM 🧩
- Event Handlers 🖱️
- Forms 📝

## Files
- `index.html` — contains a single `<div id="root"></div>`. All UI is created from JS. ✨
- `index.js` — implementations for the three exercises.

## Run
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Exercises
1) Select a kind of Music 🎵 — shows the selected value; adds `Classic` and selects it by default.
2) Delete colors 🎨 — button calls `removecolor()` to remove the selected color.
3) Shopping list 🛒 — `shoppingList` array; `addItem()` and `clearAll()` buttons; items render in a list.
