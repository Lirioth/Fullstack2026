# Exercises XP — JavaScript (Arrays, Loops, Objects)

A small collection of JS practice exercises with a minimal HTML runner. Each task logs to the page and to the console.

## Files
- `index.html` — buttons and `<pre>` blocks to display the output of each exercise.
- `script.js` — implementations for Exercises 1–7 plus some small helpers.

## How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click a specific **Run** button to execute that exercise, or **Run ALL**.
3. Use **Clear** to wipe all `<pre>` outputs.
4. Also open DevTools → Console to see the same logs.

## Helpers
- `printOut(id, lines)` — prints to the `<pre>` with the given id and mirrors to console.
- `clearAll()` — clears all `<pre>` outputs.
