# Exercises XP — Advanced JS (Scope, Ternary, Template Strings, Advanced/Arrow Functions)

Short, commented solutions in vanilla JavaScript. A single page shows outputs and writes some results to the DOM. Open DevTools → Console for more details.

## Files
- `index_advanced_js.html` — HTML with sections for each exercise.
- `advanced_js.js` — All solutions (with comments and minimal UI hooks).
- `README_Advanced_JS.md` — This file.

## How to run
1. Place files in the same folder.
2. Open `index_advanced_js.html` in your browser.
3. Use the buttons to print summaries/results, and check the **Console** for logs.

## What’s implemented
- **Ex. 1 — Scope**: Original snippets preserved (alerts disabled). Predictions explained in comments and summarized in the UI.
- **Ex. 2 — Ternary**: `winBattle` as arrow + ternary `experiencePoints`.
- **Ex. 3 — isString**: Arrow function returning true for strings, false otherwise.
- **Ex. 4 — Sum**: One-line arrow `add(a,b)`.
- **Ex. 5 — Kg→grams**: Declaration, expression, and one-line arrow; includes one-line note on hoisting difference.
- **Ex. 6 — Fortune teller**: Self-invoking function writes message into the DOM.
- **Ex. 7 — Welcome**: Navbar populated via IIFE with user name + simple avatar initial.
- **Ex. 8 — Juice Bar**: Nested functions; Part I logs once, Part II pushes 6 ingredients and displays the final sentence.

## Notes
- Pure JS; no frameworks or external assets.
- Alerts from the scope exercise are commented to avoid intrusive pop-ups. Uncomment if you want the exact runtime effect.
