### JavaScript (script.js)

1. **Global State Management**:

   - `MAX_POKEMON`: Total number of Pok√©mon (1010)

2. **Core Functions**:
   - `fetchPokemon(id)`: Async function to fetch Pok√©mon data from API
   - `getRandomPokemon()`: Gets and displays a random Pok√©mon
   - `getPreviousPokemon()`: Navigates to previous Pok√©mon
   - `getNextPokemon()`: Navigates to next Pok√©mon

   - `displayPokemonImage()`: Shows Pok√©mon artwork on screen
   - `displayPokemonInfo()`: Shows Pok√©mon details in info panel
   - `showLoading()`: Displays loading state
   - `showError()`: Displays error messages

4. **Button Management**:
   - `disableButtons()`: Disables all buttons during loading
   - `enableButtons()`: Re-enables buttons after operation

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**: Open `index.html` in your web browser

2. **Get Random Pok√©mon**: 
   - Press the **green button** on the right side of the Pokedex
   - A random Pok√©mon will appear with its information

3. **Navigate Through Pok√©mon**:
   - Press the **left button** on the D-pad to see the previous Pok√©mon
   - Press the **right button** on the D-pad to see the next Pok√©mon
   - Navigation wraps around (after #1010 it goes to #1, and vice versa)

4. **View Information**:
   - **Screen (top)**: Shows the official Pok√©mon artwork
   - **Info Display (bottom)**: Shows:
     - Pok√©mon name
     - Pok√©dex number
     - Height (in meters)
     - Weight (in kilograms)
     - Type(s) with colored badges

## API Integration

The app uses the PokeAPI endpoints:
- `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}` - Fetches Pok√©mon data

Data retrieved includes:
- Name
- ID number
- Height and weight
- Types
- Sprites (official artwork)

## Error Handling

The application handles:
- Network errors
- Invalid Pok√©mon IDs
- API unavailability
- Missing data

Error message displayed: "Oh no! That Pokemon isn't available..."

## Technical Implementation

### Async/Await Pattern
All API calls use async/await for clean, readable asynchronous code:

```javascript
async function fetchPokemon(pokemonId) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemonId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
}
```

### Global State
The `currentPokemonId` variable maintains state between button clicks, enabling sequential navigation:

```javascript
let currentPokemonId = null;
```

### Button State Management
Buttons are disabled during API calls to prevent multiple simultaneous requests and race conditions.

## Design Features

- **Authentic Pokedex Look**: Red device body with black screen borders
- **D-pad Controls**: Classic directional pad for navigation
- **Info Display**: Tan-colored screen mimicking original Pokedex
- **Green Button**: Shiny green button with realistic lighting effect
- **Decorative Elements**: Dots, indicator light, and hinge details
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects for Pok√©mon appearances

## Responsive Design

The Pokedex adapts to different screen sizes:
- Desktop: Full Pokedex layout with side-by-side controls
- Mobile: Stacked layout with info display on top

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript
- Fetch API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS animations

## Installation

No installation required. Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
