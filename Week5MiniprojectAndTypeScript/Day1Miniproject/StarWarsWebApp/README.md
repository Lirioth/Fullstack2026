## Implemented Features

### JavaScript (script.js)

1. **DOM Element Retrieval**: References to necessary elements
2. **Random ID Generation**: Function to get a number between 1-83
3. **UI States**:
   - `showLoading()`: Displays loading spinner
   - `showError()`: Displays error message
   - `displayCharacter()`: Displays character information
4. **API Requests**:
   - `getCharacterData()`: Fetches character data
   - `getHomeworldName()`: Fetches home planet name
   - `findRandomCharacter()`: Main function that coordinates the entire process

### CSS (styles.css)

- Black background with animated stars effect
- Information card with golden borders characteristic of Star Wars
- Animations for logo, loading spinner, and button
- Hover and active styles for better UX
- Media queries for responsive design

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click the "Find Someone" button
3. Watch the loading indicator while the information is being fetched
4. The random character's information will be displayed
5. Click again to get another character

## Error Handling

The application handles the following cases:
- Network errors
- Characters not available in the API
- Issues fetching the home planet

In case of error, the message displayed is: "Oh No! That person isn't available."

## Demo

The application displays:
- **Star Wars Logo** with golden glow effect
- **Information Card** with the following data:
  - Character name
  - Height
  - Gender
  - Birth Year
  - Home World
- **"Find Someone" Button** with hover effects and disabled state during loading

## Installation

No installation required. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.

## Technical Notes

- The SWAPI API contains 83 different characters
- Async/await is used to handle promises in a more readable way
- Two requests are made: one for the character and another to get the planet name
- The button is disabled during loading to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
